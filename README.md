# WebGL-Cloth-Simulation
WebGL Cloth simulation by Verlet integration method and calculation of the stress map in it. 

The Cloth is represented as a grid of dots connected by rigid rods. During the simulation, the fabric changes color depending on the tension of the fabric at each of the vertices according to Hooke's law.
